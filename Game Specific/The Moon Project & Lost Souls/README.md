## UCS-Camp
*by Cayenne*

UCS-Camp is one of the best TMP mods I've seen. You can guess from the name that the mod has something to do with the UCS campaign. Exactly!!! UCS-Camp is a completely new look at UCS campaign in TMP. The main changes are: different behavior of the computer, change of the order and times of inventions, reconstruction of some maps. The most important change, however, is the level of difficulty campaign that is higher than the level of LOST SOULS !! That's why I recommend the mod only to diehard Earth fans! It is delicious, but it goes to break your teeth on it :-) Detailed list of changes and how to install in the Polish Readme file - many thanks to Timberwolf for translating.
